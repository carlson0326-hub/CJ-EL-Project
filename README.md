# CJ-EL-Project

First off, download VS code from the Microsoft store. Hopefully your brain can understand that activity.
Then, go to the "source control" window on the left hand VS Code menu and press "clone repository."
Press the green "code" button on Github, copy that link, and paste it into the bar that says "Provide Repository URL."

Now you have this project pulled into your computer and can see how a basic web app is setup using Node.js. We will implement
React later but for now a simple understanding of Node and how it works to run servers is fine for the first day. While you're at it,
press the "extensions" button on the left hand menu and download the extensions: "Debugger for Chrome," "Node.js extensions pack," "Node.js Modules Intellisense," "NPM commands," "NPM Support," and "NPM Intellisense" (I might be forgetting some but you can just easily download them later.)

Now for the important part, go to the top part of the screen and press Terminal -> New Terminal.
In that terminal that just opened at the bottom, type the line:   node server.js

If all went well, if you go to Google Chrome and check the address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ you will see a nice message for you. 
If you want to see how the JSONS work, look at the JSON file in the project and how it is connected in the server.js file, and go to the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/listings
That covers some of the basic concepts of server hosting, webpage routing, and information display/transfer. Once you get that, later on it will be easy for you to see how JSONs can be pulled from various APIs and instantly displayed on your own computer projects. 

React and Express will come in later, all they do is make the data look pretty and not like a piece of shit when it is displayed, which is how websites look good even though they serve alot of different data. Hopefully you get it running and I didn't forget anything random and you get to have a basic understanding of everything.
